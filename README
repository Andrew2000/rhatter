Rail 3 + JQuerymobile app using the Chatter REST API

This sample app uses the Chatter REST API
to implement a Chatter client in Rails3. In addition, it 
uses jquerymobile to make this app accessible on just about any
mobile device.

Setup:

The app uses Omniauth for OAuth2 authentication. You will need to change
the consumer key and consumer secret which the forcedotcom strategy uses
to authorize against a Force.com remote access provider. Settings are
contained within config/initializers/omniauth.rb

You will also need to change the site url in lib/forcedotcom.rb. Right
now it points to a pre-release org which has the Chatter REST API enabled.

Yes I know I need to move these into env settings. I'll get around to it soon :)

Finally, as the remote access provider requires a https callback url, you
need to create your certs and keys for your local web server. I have already
set up the rails web server (WEBrick) with all the script changes. As long
as you drop your keys and certs into the lib/certs dir you should be good to go


Using the app:

Once you have everything up and running on your local machine, navigate to 
the default url (https://localhost:3000/) and you should be all good to go!


Have fun
